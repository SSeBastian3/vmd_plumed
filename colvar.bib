  abstractNote = {The authors present a new method for searching low
                  free energy paths in complex molecular systems at
                  finite temperature. They introduce two variables
                  that are able to describe the position of a point in
                  configurational space relative to a preassigned
                  path. With the help of these two variables the
                  authors combine features of approaches such as
                  metadynamics or umbrella sampling with those of path
                  based methods. This allows global searches in the
                  space of paths to be performed and a new variational
                  principle for the determination of low free energy
                  paths to be established. Contrary to metadynamics or
                  umbrella sampling the path can be described by an
                  arbitrary large number of variables, still the
                  energy profile along the path can be calculated. The
                  authors exemplify the method numerically by studying

                  and some reference system can easily be written as
                  an ensemble average, but the conventional Monte
                  Carlo methods of obtaining such averages are
                  inadequate for the free-energy case. That is because
                  the Boltzmann-weighted sampling distribution
                  ordinarily used is extremely inefficient for the

                  sampling distributions chosen to facilitate such
                  estimates. The methods have been tested successfully
                  on the Lennard-Jones system over a wide range of
                  temperature and density, including the gas-liquid

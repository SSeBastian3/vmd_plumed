Manual installation (recommended)
----------------------------------------

Installation requires these steps:

1. Identify your VMD installation directory (let's call it
   $VMDDIR). In VMD's console, you can use:
      puts $env(VMDDIR)

2. Copy the script's distribution directory (after archive extraction)
   into $VMDDIR/plugins/noarch/tcl

3. Copy or move the file <PACKAGENAME>_init.tcl into
   $VMDDIR/scripts/init.d , creating said directory if it does not
   exist already.

Note that you will need write privileges in VMD's program directory.
The plugin should appear in the "Extensions" menu upon VMD's next run.




Usage without installation
----------------------------------------

As a last resort, plugins may be loaded without installation by
issuing a "source xxx.tcl" command for each of the distributed .tcl
files, with the exclusion of "<PACKAGENAME>_init.tcl" and examples.

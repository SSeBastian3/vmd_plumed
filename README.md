Plumed-GUI
==========
 
A Plumed collective variable analysis tool for VMD
------------

The PLUMED-GUI collective variable analysis tool is a plugin for the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software that provides access to the extensive set of collective variables (CV) defined in the PLUMED. It allows you to:

- analyze the currently loaded trajectory by evaluating and plotting arbitrary CVs
- use VMD's atom selection keywords to define atom groups and ready-made templates for common CVs
- export the CV definition file for use in MD simulations
- prepare reference files for RMSD, path-variable, native contacts, etc.
- analyze DCD files in batches

Original (biased) simulation + bias.plumed  ----> n.plumed 
|	 	  	       		    	  |
+-- HILLS (stride h, ncv)			  +-- COLVAR (m) at stride n
|
+-- COLVAR (stride b)


ncv + m = nvar

stride h = HILLS STRIDE

stride b = stride n = dcdframe,  (unless b was generated during the simulation with PRINT_W, which we don't do)

checks

len(dcd) % len(HILLS) == 0
	 / 	      > 1 = stride

hills(t,j)==colvar(t*stride,j)

-ncv <-- take from HILLS

execute driver

no. of variables in the new script - ncv is the new, reweighted variables

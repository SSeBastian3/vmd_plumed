Dear Prof. Truhlar,

thank you for managing my manuscript. I am writing to you to kindly inquire about whether there are any updates in the review process of said paper. Sorry for this request, but together with the authors of the PLUMED paper (which is now in press) we were wondering if the two manuscripts were going to appear more or less in the same time frame.

I remain faithfully yours,

Toni Giorgino

Dear Prof. Truhlar, 

thank you for managing my "PLUMED-GUI" manuscript. I am writing to you to kindly inquire about whether there are any updates in the review process of said paper. Sorry for my request, but I was wondering - together with the authors of the companion PLUMED paper (which is now in press) - if the two manuscripts were going to appear more or less in the same time frame, in order to synchronize the projects' releases.

I remain yours sincerely,

Toni Giorgino
